# keeper-app

This is a personal project I worked on.  
The aim of the project was to learn how to make a web application with backend, database and user authentication.  
The main technologies used in this project are the **React** library for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend and **MongoDB** for the database.  
The product is a web app for storing notes and the idea is borrowed from Google Keep.  
Part of the project was made by following the course "The complete web development bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.com.  
The result after following the course is only the frontend made in React - https://58bxk.csb.app/  
The parts developed by myself are the Login and User components on React and the backend. The final product also includes user authentication and a non-relational database where the user data is stored. 

The final product is hosted on Heroku - https://keeper-app-4625.herokuapp.com/  
The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
